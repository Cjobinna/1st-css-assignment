    <p>In 2016, the sport of Volleyball is over 120 years old!
        The sport originated in the United States, and is now just achieving the type of popularity in the U.S. that it
        has received on a global basis, where it ranks behind only soccer among participation sports.
        Today there are more than 46 million Americans who play volleyball. There are 800 million players worldwide who
        play volleyball at least once a week.
        In 1895, William G. Morgan, an instructor at the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Mass.,
        decided to blend elements of basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball to create a game for his classes of
        businessmen which would demand less physical contact than basketball. He created the game of Volleyball (at that
        time called, Mintonette). Morgan borrowed the net from tennis, and raised it 6 feet 6 inches above the floor,
        just above the average man’s head.
        During a demonstration game, someone remarked to Morgan that the players seemed to be volleying the ball back
        and forth over the net, and perhaps “volleyball” would be a more descriptive name for the sport. On July 7, 1896
        at Springfield College the first game of “volleyball” was played.
